selector.php:

This tool enables/disables methods within the library mapping.
Takes "full_classes_set.json" and generates "classes.json". This tool 
already requires the wxwidgets library module. It's part of a later 
development, initially the method mapping was done by hand.

full_classes_set.json:

Holds a lightly modified copy of the classes.json generated 
by the xml parser.
	
classes.json: 

Holds the selected methods using the GUI utility. This file is 
automatically copied to the dumps directory on the 	source_maker 
directory each time the go.sh/go.bat is ran.

manual_changes.txt:

Registry of manual changes done to full_classes_set.json.
Note that if you make changes to methods on full_classes_set.json
and they are enabled on the classes.json you will have to manually 
apply those changes also to classes.json since the GUI utility doesnt 
detects this and garbage would be left hanging, producing compilation 
errors. (duplicated methods with different definitions)

Because of possible errors when updating the full_classes_set.json by
running the xml_parser, I wrote a tool that tries as much to 
synchronize the classes.json with the full_classes_set.json on the
tools directory called merge.php
