Things manually added/changed to files
......................................

This file serves as a registry of manual changes made to the generated
files of the xml_parser. So if we need to regenarate again these files
we dont have to go to the whole process of inspecting everything
and just focus on the changes store here.

These changes are done in order to generate the correct code
to successfully compile.
