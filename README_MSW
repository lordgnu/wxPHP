Windows Compilation Issues:
=====================================

mode_t is defined on wxWidgets and PHP at the same time

	Fix: On TSRM/tsrm_virtual_cwd.h substitute:
		
		typedef unsigned short mode_t;
		
		with
		
		#ifndef __WXMSW__
		typedef unsigned short mode_t;
		#endif
		
wxPosScriptDC Not enabled by default on wxMSW

	Fix: On wxWidgets lib\vc_lib\mswu\wx\setup.h set:
		wxUSE_POSTSCRIPT 1 
		
Linking errors where produced from some deprecated 
methods that seemed to be implemented on log.cpp but 
strangely enough are producing linking errors 

	Fix: removed the following declarations/prototypes from the wxwidgets 
		 include/wx/log.h

		wxLogFormatter::FormatTime(long)const
		wxLog::DoLog(unsigned long,wchar_t const *,long)
		wxLog::DoLog(unsigned long,char const *,long)

		
Notes:
=====================================

Here I write some methods I needed to disable since
they aren't implemented, what produces linking errors.
Should be reported to wxWidgets as a bug.

	wxRichToolTip::SetTitleFont(class wxFont const &)
	wxPoint2DDouble::SetPolarCoordinates(double,double)
	wxPoint2DInt::SetPolarCoordinates(int,int)
